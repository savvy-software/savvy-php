# Savvy API SDK for PHP 

[![Build Status](https://github.com/savvy-software/savvy-php/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/savvy-software/savvy-php)

This library helps with integrating Savvy into PHP applications.

## Installation

This library can be installed via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```bash
composer require savvy-software/savvy-php
```

## Configuration

The only required configuration is the Environment Token. You can get your Environment Token via the [Project settings](https://app.havesavvy.com/admin/projects) in your Savvy account.

Configuration values can be set when creating a new API client or via environment variables. The environment takes precedence over values provided during the initialization process.

**Configuration via environment variables**

```bash
SAVVY_ENVIRONMENT_TOKEN=tok-sample
```

**Configuration during initialization**

```php
$client = new \Savvy\Client(['environment_token' => 'tok-sample']);
```

## Context

When retrieving values for settings a context can be provided that can change the value based on unique attributes of the context.

```php
$context = new \Savvy\Settings\Entities\Context\Context('user', 'John Doe', 'john-doe'[
    new \Savvy\Settings\Entities\Context\Attribute('key', [
        new \Savvy\Settings\Entities\Context\Value('value'),
    ]),
]);

$client = new \Savvy\Client([
    'environment_token' => 'tok-sample-token',
    'context' => $context,
]);
```

## Usage

Before retrieving a setting or flag, create a new client. If you configured your environment token key via environment variables there's nothing to add. Otherwise, see the example above.

```php
$client = new \Savvy\Client();
```

### Retrieving Settings

#### All settings

```php
$results = $client->settings();

foreach ($results as $result)
{
    $key = $result->key;
    $name = $result->name;
    $type = $result->type;
    $value = $result->value
}
```

#### Single setting

```php
$result = $client->setting('setting-key');

$key = $result->key;
$name = $result->name;
$type = $result->type;
$value = $result->value
```
